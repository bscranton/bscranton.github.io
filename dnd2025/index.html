<h1>Let&rsquo;s play a game.</h1>

<h2>Where we&rsquo;re at.</h2>

<p>&lsquo;Sup chummer. Welcome to Midgaard. A long time ago this place was a humble
city astride a river where adventurers gathered. We hosted a school even.
The school is still here. These days it&rsquo;s called Midgaard University
Diversified School, or MUD School. It&rsquo;s a modern place. Lots of steel and
glass. The University occupies about a block of downtown. Downtown covers
about 25 square miles. Directly across Market Street from the University
campus is the Mota Arcology. The Arcology covers about 4 city blocks. the
first 10 stories of each block arch toward the others until they meet above
the intersection of Temple and Main Streets. The whole arcology is 197
stories high. The Mota Arcology is not the tallest building downtown. The
whole city, including the burbs and the slums and the sprawl covers almost
400 square miles. This place is fragging huge, chummer. But for people like
us it&rsquo;s a world of opportunity isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<h2>Real talk about the setting.</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re gonna play D&amp;D, but this isn&rsquo;t exactly some grubby faux-medieval
setting. There are still lords, ladies, dragons and magic. But there are
also motorcycles, machineguns, leather jackets and pink mohawks. Elves
host EDM festivals and take magic ecstasy. Orks play death metal to summon
demons in shady clubs in the &lsquo;hood.
I&rsquo;m drawing inspiration from games like <a href="https://www.catalystgamelabs.com/brands/shadowrun">Shadowrun</a>, Final Fantasy 3 &amp; 7,
shows like <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/firefly-044bbd6e-4ef5-4723-93fe-a384d785b45d">Firefly</a> and <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80119234">Bright</a>, and books like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61240297-snow-crash">Snow Crash</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6088007-neuromancer">Neuromancer</a>.
It&rsquo;s like if the Forgotten Realms were advanced to the 1980s. But it&rsquo;s
still D&amp;D.</p>

<h2>Makin' dudes and babes.</h2>

<h3>Rollin' stats.</h3>

<p>Roll 4d6, drop the lowest. You only get to do this once. Exactly once.
Don&rsquo;t keep going just because your first rolls didn&rsquo;t land a bunch of
18s and 17s. I mean it. I&rsquo;ll know if you cheat. It&rsquo;ll be fine, I promise.</p>

<h3>Pick a species.</h3>

<p>Any race in the rulebook is fair game. You get whatever the race says you
do <em>except</em> for stat increases. Ignore any changes to stats from your race,
positive or negative. Instead, add +2 to any one stat and +1 to any other.
You can&rsquo;t use both modifiers on the same stat. No +3. You&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>

<h3>Pick a background.</h3>

<p>Any background in the rulebook is fair game. Try to think of ways that
these backgrounds might fit into a retro-futuristic setting. Your soldier
might be a member of S.O.L.D.I.E.R. Or your charlatan might be a city
councilperson. Your entertainer might be an actual rockstar.</p>

<h3>Pick a class.</h3>

<p>Anything in the rulebook goes. Consider how whatever class you pick might
be affected by 1980&rsquo;s tech. Your wizard can probably pack an uzi. Your
fighter might still carry a big-ass sword. Or maybe a katana. Or
maybe a monofilament blade. Or a bazooka. Whatever. Your ranger might
have drones instead of actual animals. Good luck figuring out how the hell
a druid fits into a city run by an oppressive empire and a bunch of
megacorps.</p>

<h3>Buy gear and shit.</h3>

<p>The biggest divergence from normal D&amp;D is there is only one currency.
Everyone uses Imperial Credits. They&rsquo;re electronic currency stored on
physical credsticks. Sort of like bitcoin but on USB sticks. Oh and every
citizen of the Empire is microchipped at birth. Every citizen of the Empire
is assigned a System Identification Number, a SIN, at birth. Your SIN is
like your social security number. Everything the Empire knows about you is
tied to your SIN. And the Empire would like to think they know <em>everything</em>
about you. Some people fall through the cracks, of course. Mostly poor people
and <em>foreigners</em>. It is almost impossible to get by in the city without a SIN.
But some people do it. Sometimes because they have to, and sometimes because
they don&rsquo;t want to be controlled by <em>the man</em>. When you&rsquo;re making your guy
you can choose to be SINless. Be aware that conducting business in the city,
even mundane stuff like using public transportion or buying coffee, is much
harder when you&rsquo;re SINless. But the Empire has a much harder time tracking
you. If you choose to be SINless, start with half the credits (gold pieces)
your class would usually start with, but gain proficiency in one tool or
one skill of your choice. That tool or skill is how you get by on the street.</p>

<p>Ignore starting gold for your class. Everyone starts with 5d4 * 10 credits
You still get whatever gold your background would give you, just remember
they&rsquo;re called credits, not gold. If you&rsquo;re SINless, divide the total number
by 2.</p>

<p>When you buy equipment you can buy almost anything you can imagine that
might have been available in 1987. This means your &ldquo;gaming set&rdquo; can be
a gameboy.</p>

<p>The following weapons are <em>examples</em>. If there&rsquo;s something else you want
let&rsquo;s talk about it and make it happen. Don&rsquo;t be shy about sticking to more
traditional fantasy archetypes either, if that&rsquo;s what makes you happy.
Cloud, Barrett and Red XIII all occupied the same universe. It&rsquo;s a big world,
play what you want. Just don&rsquo;t jaywalk on Market Street if you don&rsquo;t want
to get run over by a bus.</p>

<p>And you might be a little out of place in full plate armor. The locals will
assume you&rsquo;re headed to a renfaire.</p>

<h4>Proficiencies</h4>

<p>These weapons follow the same proficiency rules as any other weapons in the
rulebook. If you are proficient in simple or martial weapons then you are
proficient with these. If you are able to choose a specific weapon proficiency,
you can choose one of these.</p>

Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the weapon&rsquo;s normal damage. This action uses 10 rounds of ammunition. </td>

<h4>Other stuff.</h4>

<p>If you want to start with things you can&rsquo;t necessarily afford, let&rsquo;s talk
about it. Things like houses and cars and computers and whatever are all
reasonable requests beyond normal starting gear. I&rsquo;m going to make you
justify it to me though. Why do you get to have a Ferarri or a luxury
condo in an upscale <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcology">arcology</a>?
Maybe your background or back story justifies it. That&rsquo;s fine. We can
negotiate it.</p>
